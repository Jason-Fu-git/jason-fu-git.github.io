I am currently an undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, majoring in Computer Science and supervised by [Dr. Xiaolin Hu](https://xlhu.cn/). 
My fields of interest include:

* <b>Artificial Intelligence:</b> My primary focus is on the intersection of AI and neuroscience, particularly in the realm of brain-inspired AI. I am particularly interested in the development of brain-like neural networks and their applications in various fields, like computer vision and audio segmentation.
* <b>Computational Neuroscience:</b> I am fascinated by the intricate workings of the human brain and how it processes information. I am particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms behind perception, cognition, and decision-making. Currently, I am working on the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> connectome, 
aiming to uncover the neural circuits that govern perception and cognition.

Internship and summer research programs are welcome. I am eager to explore opportunities that align with my interests and aspirations. If you have any suggestions or know of any programs, please feel free to reach out to me.
